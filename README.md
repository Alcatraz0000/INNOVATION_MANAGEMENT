# Innovation Management

## Project Overview

This project involves our team in designing a new innovation in some field following the requirement of the Agenda 2035. In this project we try to create a way to utiize the second hands battery from elettric vehicle and sell it as accumulators for the house. In this way we can reutilize the residual capacity of the battery to store extra energy gained from Solar Panel for example.
